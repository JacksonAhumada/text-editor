  ## Description
  I wanted to create an app that gives the user a place online to write lines of code line in any other code editor. I also wanted to give the user an option to download a standalone app that would reflect any code that was writen in the online app and reflect it in the downloaded app and vice versa.

  ## Installation
  To install the standalone app just click either the install button on the top of the page or the install icon on the right of the url.

  ## Usage
  To use the app just visit the website or launch the downloaded app.
